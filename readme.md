# **TyT \- To Youtube 🎬**

Welcome to TyT (To Youtube), the tool that lets you download videos and audio from YouTube for free. 💯

## **What is TyT? 🤔**

TyT is a compact program I built using batch, designed for all of you. It's powered by the mighty **yt-dlp.exe** tool.

## **How do you use it? 🤓**

1. **Download the Zip:** First, download the zip file.  
2. **Run:** Inside the zip file, open the **Main.bat** file.  
3. **Paste Link:** A window will pop up asking you to paste the link for the video or playlist you want to download.  
4. **Choose Format:** After you paste the link, the program will ask if you want to download the video with **Video \+ Audio** or just the **Audio** (MP3). Choose what you want.  
5. **Download:** That's it. Let the program do its thing. The file will be saved to the same folder where the **Main.bat** file is located.

## **What do you need? 💻**

For everything to run smoothly, you need to make sure that the **yt-dlp.exe** file is in the same folder as the **Main.bat** file\!

## **Troubleshooting 🛠️**

If something's not working, try these things:

* **Check Connection**
* **Update yt-dlp**
* **Update TyT**
